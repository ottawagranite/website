This repository holds the work on the new website for the Granite Curling 
Club of West Ottawa.

The project uses:

* Python: http://www.python.org
* Django: http://www.djangoproject.com

Temporarily hosted during development on Heroku at

http://thawing-inlet-5759.herokuapp.com/

The principles of the new site should be

* Simple, intuitive layout
* A minimum of clicks to reach anything
* Consistency throughout in look and feel
* Data-driven wherever possible instead of "hand editing" pages
